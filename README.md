 Fizzbuzz
In this assignment, build a FizzBuzz app from scratch.
For each number if it’s not divisible by 3 or 5, you simply say the number. If it’s divisible by 3, instead of the number you say “fizz”. If it’s divisible by 5, you say “buzz”. And finally if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, you say “fizz buzz”. 

The requirements for this app are as follows:

DO NOT spend any time designing this app or making it look pretty. We don’t want you to consider UX at all here, since the point is to build up your programming fundamentals.
The program should print out each number (not 'one' for 1, but 1 for 1), from 1 to 100, replacing numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with “fizz buzz”, those divisible by 3 with “fizz”, and those divisible by 5 with “buzz”.
